oh, man!  i had a brilliant thought on the whole "parcel height" issue.  i need to think about it some more, but i feel like it can two-birds-one-stone answer a couple really important questions for us:

1) how high can people build on their parcels?

2) how do we enable experiences which require large swaths of land, but without buying a bajillion contiguous parcels.

lemme run it by some folks internally, and then i'll talk more about it here.  i'd hate to get everyone's hopes up and then not be able to deliver because of some technical impossibility that i don't fully understand yet.

my friend andrew is making some really fun stuff with a 2d web rpg bent.  which, if you know him, is totally what he's always doing.  makes me long for the days of fun sprite animations.

check out his cool rpg persona thing here:

it uses this spritesheet for its data:
