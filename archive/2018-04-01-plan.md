# an awesome .plan

wow.  now that i've decided to build this, i just want to dump ALL the information in here.  and all of it, _RIGHT NOW_.

i'll have to exercise patience, i guess.

anyway.

oh.

i know!

one of the first things i should take care of is letting everyone know about my new job.  ari and esteban over at decentraland talked me into leaving disney and helping them make the next version of the internet.

so, yeah.  i work for decentraland now.

virtual worlds, ftw!

speaking of keeping up on things, for the new folks in the back [grins, points to the back, listens to a room filled with cricket chirps], this is who i am:  [https://m3mnoch.com/about](https://m3mnoch.com/about)

that's where you can scoop up all the dirt on me.  and, there's plenty to dig through.  i've been doing this internet thing for a long time.

alrighty.  that's enough fun for the day.  i've got 1/2 an hour to finish up this simple cannon/target ai using our pre-release sdk before i have to start building shelves for the wife.
