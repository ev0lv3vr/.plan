# an awesome .plan

today, we're totally gonna get on with this little demo scene.  (not to be confused with [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), of course). basically, i'm making an example starter scene with worldly, game-like components.

aka, a cylinder cannon that shoots spheres at box targets without any physics.

my plan:

* attachable component for target moves
* attachable component for cannon auto-fire
* attachable component for player fire control

so, in theory, you'll be able to shoot a ball at a target on keypress, or just let the ai do it.

all the plumbing seems to finally be working, so it's just hooking up all the interactions now.

heh.  so, my .plan gets tweeted out now when i rotate it.  i'm such a nerd.

oooh!  i have to go move the car!  our new dining room table is getting delivered!

_whew_

lots of heads-down code-slinging today.  got most of everything worked out.  i have wandering targets and a cannon that automatically fires at them.  i worked in some bare-bones squared-distance collision detection, so tomorrow there will be "explosions".

heh.  more like the targets just turning black and melting into the ground.

still.  pretty neat.

and then . . . doh!  we don't really have any keyboard input support yet for the user-controls.  so, i couldn't hotswap the controls back and forth from humans to the ai.  but, i guess it makes sense since there's not keyboard inputs in vr.  duh.

tho, it makes prototyping hard.

anyway.  that's enough for today.  the wife is making some fresh salmon for dinner and we've got a badass new dining room table to eat at.  yay!
