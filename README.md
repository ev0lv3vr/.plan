so, [cryptocarz](https://www.cryptocarz.io/) looks pretty sweet.  that'd be awesome if we figured out how to get my car to display correctly in-world.

gltf support, ftw.

this whole concept of using decentraland to visualize all of these crypto-collectible-assets that are coming out is totally the right direction for us to take.

if you're a company building crypto-collectibles, give me a holler.  let's figure out how to get your stuff visualized in 3d so your players can show their collections off to other people in the world.

i absolutely love the heavy retro-design influences on all these low-poly vr models.  the perf constraints are making for some amazing-looking art.

the combo of "low enough poly for stereo-camera vr" with "low enough poly for web regular 3d" is really a sweet spot right now.  and it's having deep design influences across the idustry.
