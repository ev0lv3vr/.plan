# an awesome .plan

today, we're totally gonna get on with this little demo scene.  (not to be confused with [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), of course). basically, i'm making an example starter scene with worldly, game-like components.

aka, a cylinder cannon that shoots spheres at box targets without any physics.

my plan:

* attachable component for target moves
* attachable component for cannon auto-fire
* attachable component for player fire control

so, in theory, you'll be able to shoot a ball at a target on keypress, or just let the ai do it.

all the plumbing seems to finally be working, so it's just hooking up all the interactions now.
