dammit.  today, for real, i'm scraping together all this sample code.

for really, reals!

---

working through the use cases on using the sdk, cli, and client.  it's pretty cool seeing all this stuff coming together.

our workflow will probably end up being something like this:

1. install the dcl cli.
2. type `dcl init`.
3. [sling all your javascript code here.]
4. type `dcl preview` to check it out locally.
5. type `dcl deploy` to push it to out to your parcel.

i mean, it should be really, really simple by the time we've got it worked through.  it's pretty freakin' exciting.

showed off some of the behind-the-scenes stuff to the guys in the #development discord channel.  it's super-exciting to start talking about all this hard work the team has been doing.

i can't wait to get more people's hands on this.

holy cow!  talking to the guys about doing a dev-diary style podcast or twitch stream.  what do you guys think?  would that be interesting?

i'd grab various people around the org and drag them in front of a camera/mic and ask them about the super-cool stuff they're working on.  where they see things going.  what they ate for breakfast -- you know, only the important stuff.

i'd toooootally be up for that.  we should do it.
