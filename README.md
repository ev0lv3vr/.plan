# an awesome .plan

so, this morning i was thinking more about how i want to try consensus-based, world state authority by [rafting](https://raft.github.io/) clients together.  because, not having a runtime server for an virtual world is a sticky problem to solve.

which means i'm puttering around, digging for inspiration, and i found a new, sweet-looking mmo architecture book!  it's called [Development and Deployment of Multiplayer Online Games, Vol. I: Gdd, Authoritative Servers, Communications (Development and Deployment of Multiplayer Games) ](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/3903213063/ref=pe_354120_277987370_em_1p_2_ti) -- obvs, a freaking mouthful but whatever.

digging through the tables of contents, it actually looks really good.  it seems like it's got a well-enumerated list of commonly-known-but-rarely-documented tribal knowledge.  i'm actually pretty excited about it.  mostly because a) there's strong confirmation bias of how my mmo mental model works after all these years, and b) it's a documented list of stuff that i always forget until the subject comes up.  "oh yeah, that doesn't actually work like that.  it should be done like this.  sorry, i totally should have mentioned that!  oops!"

man, sometimes having a shitty memory sucks.

anyhow.

also, during my digging, i found a presentation for c4 -- i'd heard of it, but haven't ever taken the time to dig in.  might be useful for wrapping vocabulary around difficult-to-explain concepts.

there's a youtube of [simon brown talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=165&v=m76bR16EhrU).

seemed useful.
