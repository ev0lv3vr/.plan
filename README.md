dammit.  today, for real, i'm scraping together all this sample code.

for really, reals!

working through the use cases on using the sdk, cli, and client.  it's pretty cool seeing all this stuff coming together.

our workflow will probably end up being something like this:

1. install the dcl cli.
2. type `dcl init`.
3. [sling all your javascript code here.]
4. type `dcl preview` to check it out locally.
5. type `dcl deploy` to push it to out to your parcel.

i mean, it should be really, really simple by the time we've got it worked through.  it's pretty freakin' exciting.
