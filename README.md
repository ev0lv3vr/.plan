# an awesome .plan

going through my list of stuff i accomplished this past week for a project update.

at first, i felt like i didn't get much done.  dude.  duuuuuude. looking back at my notes, and the amount of stuff i've built feels like i crammed about a month into a week.  srsly, time-dilation is happening.

my list:

- based on a large team tech review, developed a plan for a game starter kit.
- built out a "product fit" spreadsheet which is leading to a blog post.
- built a bunch of game shims to wrap the core api.  these aren't things we want to necessarily build into the platform since there will be MANY non-game scenes out there.
- recreated the "color-rotating cube moves in a square" scene, but as a snap-on ai component you can attach to any object.
- designed a simple game-like experience -- cannon popping a cannonball at some autonomous, roaming targets limited to a specific play space.
- got the experience finished off but for the cannonball animation.
- wrote some management shell scripts for this badass .plan thing!  complete with tweeting it out when i rotate!
